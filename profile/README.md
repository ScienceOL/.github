### 👋🏻 Welcome to ScienceOL®

We are a group of e/acc design-engineers, hoping to provide modern and intelligent experience for Laboratory, and creating a technology-driven forum, fostering knowledge interaction and the exchange of ideas that may culminate in mutual inspiration and collaborative innovation.

By adopting the Bootstrapping approach, we aim to provide researchers, developers and users with a more open, transparent, and user-friendly product laboratory.

Whether for users or professional developers, ScienceOL will be your Science Agent playground.
